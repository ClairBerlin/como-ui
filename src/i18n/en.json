Good indoor air not only enhances our well-being, but also increases learning and work productivity, improves concentration and minimises the risk of viral infections. The CO2 concentration is widely considered a good indicator for general indoor air quality. If you know exactly when the air quality is deteriorating, you can ventilate as needed and ensure that your own premises are perceived as comfortable."

A CO2 traffic light system can only provide information about the current air quality. However, if measurement data is transmitted constantly and over a longer period of time, it allows changes and different activities taking place in the room to be compared."
