      This view will list all rooms of the selected organization, information
      about each room, air quality information of theindividual sensors
      installed in the room (once we know how to best summarize this
      information), and links to the visualizatin for each sensor. Once we learn
      how to synthesize information from multiple sensors in a single room, this
      information may be viewed here as well.
